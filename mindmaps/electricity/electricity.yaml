Electricity:
  Current and Charge:
    Current:
      - Rate of flow of charge (rate of flow of electrons)
      - Shared across elements in parallel
      - Same across elements in series
    Charge Flow:
      - The number of electrons
    Equation:
      - Q = I * t
      - charge (C) = current (A) * time (s)
      - current (A) = charge (C) / time (s)
    Other:
      Potential Difference:
        - Amount of energy transferred per unit charge
        - Same across elements in parallel
        - Shared across elements in series
      Resistance:
        - How difficult it is for current to flow through a circuit or component
        - Summed in series
        - Bit less than smallest value in parallel
      Equation:
        - V = IR
        - potential difference (V) = current (A) * resistance (Î©)

  Types of current:
    Alternating Current (AC):
      - Alternating current constantly switches between flowing in different directions
    Direct Current (DC):
      - Constantly flows in one direction
