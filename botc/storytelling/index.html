    <h1>Storytelling Guide</h1>
    <p>This is written to give a basic introduction to storytelling. Below are some useful links that will likely explain this better then I ever could</p>

    <h2>Grimoire Setup</h2>
    <img src="./images/grim.jpg" width="500">

    <h3>Specific Setup</h3>
    <p>
        On the felted (left) side (Section A), each player's character token will be located. Ensure they are arranged in a way that means you can clearly identify which one belongs to whom.
        <br>Beneath those (or anywhere you like really), you can keep the demon bluffs.
        <br>On the other side (Section B), there is additional felted space to keep spare tokens, reminders etc.
        <br><br>Section C is where I recommend keeping the night Cards. The Cards allow you to indicate information such as "You are", "These are your Minions", "These Characters are not in Play" (used for demon bluffs) etc. to the players.
        <br>The death shrouds are used in mine and are located in the same place (but make a lot of noise so may not be good to use at night).
    </p>

    <h3>Extras</h3>
    <p>
        Some things mentioned in the above videos are not directly replicated in my version of Blood on the Clocktower.
        <br><br>Moreover we do not have a "Townsquare". This is used to publicly indicate who is alive, dead or has their dead vote remaining. Instead of this, I use the small grey tokens in Section D and place them by players who have used their dead votes.
        <br><br>I also highly recommend watching the videos I linked above to get to know the general concept of storytelling better before our next session.
