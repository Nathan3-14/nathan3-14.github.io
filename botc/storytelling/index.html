    <h3>Terminology</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Character Token</b> - What role a player is
            <br>For Example <ul>
                <li>Washerwoman</li>
                <li>Slayer</li>
                <li>Imp</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Demon Bluff</b> - A character that is not in play that the Demon can use to bluff
            <br>The ones in the below Grimoire are <ul>
                <li>Fortunte Teller</li>
                <li>Monk</li>
                <li>Washerwoman</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Reminder Token</b> - Little tokens used to remind you of certain things
            <br>For Example <ul>
                <li>Imp's "Dead" token for who dies</li>
                <li>Investigator's "Decoy" and "Minion" token for who to show them</li>
                <li>Poisoner's "Poisoned" token for who is poisoned (ability doesn't work)</li>
            </ul>
            Rememder, <b>Demon Bluffs</b> are not in play so don't need reminders!
            <br>And some of these reminders (like the Washerwoman's and Fortune Teller's) need to be placed before the game starts
            <br>I recommend getting all reminder tokens out before the game starts. The number of leaves at the top of a <b>character token</b> denote how many are needed for that character.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Grimoire Setup</h2>
    <img src="./images/grim_annotated.jpeg" width="500">

    <h3>Specific Setup</h3>
    <p>
        On the felted (left) side (<span style="color: blue">Section A</span>), each player's <b>character token</b> will be located. Ensure they are arranged in a way that means you can clearly identify which one belongs to whom.
        <br>Beneath those (or anywhere you like really), you can keep the <b>demon bluffs</b>.
        <br>On the other side (<span style="color: red">Section B</span>), there is additional felted space to keep spare tokens, <b>reminder tokens</b> etc.
        <br><br><span style="color: lightgreen">Section C</span> is where I recommend keeping the night Cards. The Cards allow you to indicate information such as "You are", "These are your Minions", "These Characters are not in Play" (used for <b>demon bluffs</b>) etc. to the players.
        <br>The death shrouds are located in the same place (but can make a lot of noise so may not be good to use at night).
    </p>

    <h3>Night Order Sheet</h3>
    The night shows what order you should wake people in, as well as what you'll be doing.
    <br>The small black circles denote when you need to place a <b>reminder token</b> because of a player action.

    <h3>Extras</h3>
    <p>
        Some things mentioned in the above videos are not directly replicated in my version of Blood on the Clocktower.
        <br><br>Moreover, we do not have a "Townsquare". This is used to publicly indicate who is alive, dead or has their dead vote remaining. Instead of this, I use the small grey tokens in <span style="color: purple">Section D</span> and place them by players who have used their dead votes.
        <br><br>I also highly recommend watching the videos and completing some of the <a target="_blank" href="https://quiz.bloodontheclocktower.com/trouble-brewing-easy/question-1"><i class="fa-solid fa-xs fa-up-right-from-square"></i> Beginner Quiz Questions</a> I linked above to get to know the general concept of storytelling better before our next session.
